# Dashboard Metrics Bug Fix Report

## Issue Summary
**Problem:** Dashboard and other views showing 0 metrics despite PIRs existing in the database

**Reported By:** Tyler (tyler@glrecoveryservices.com)
**Role:** SuperAdmin
**Tenant:** glrs
**Date:** 2025-10-23

## Symptoms
1. ‚úó Dashboard stats showing: 0 PIRs, 0 Coaches, 0 Alerts
2. ‚úì "Active PIRs" widget showing 3 PIRs correctly (Heinz, Michael, Tyler)
3. ‚úó PIR Goals view: "No active PIRs found"
4. ‚úó Community tab: All metrics showing 0
5. ‚úó My PIRs view: "No PIRs Assigned" (despite Tyler being coach)

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Dashboard Stats Not Being Set (CRITICAL)**
**Location:** `DashboardView` function (line 3215-3481)

**Problem:**
Stats were being calculated correctly but `setStats()` was called AFTER all chart data loading. If any chart query failed (missing index, timeout, etc.), the entire function would error out in the catch block, leaving stats at their initial 0 values.

**Evidence:**
- activePIRs widget showed 3 PIRs (set at line 3280)
- Stats showed 0 (setStats was at line 3463, after chart queries)
- Error would occur between lines 3280-3463, preventing stats from being set

**Fix Applied:**
- Moved stats calculation and `setStats()` to line 3294-3315 (BEFORE chart data loading)
- Added comprehensive console logging for debugging
- Stats now display even if chart queries fail

```javascript
// Stats set early at line 3308-3313
setStats({
    totalPirs,
    totalCoaches,
    alertsToday: alertsSnap.size,
    avgCompliance: Math.min(avgCompliance, 100)
});
console.log('‚úÖ Stats set:', { totalPirs, totalCoaches, alertsToday, avgCompliance });
```

### 2. **Goals View - Compound Inequality Query Failure (CRITICAL)**
**Location:** `GoalsView.loadPIRsWithStats()` (line 11327-11407)

**Problem:**
Firestore compound query with inequality operator causing silent failure:

```javascript
// BROKEN QUERY (line 11330-11334)
db.collection('users')
    .where('tenantId', '==', CURRENT_TENANT)  // equality
    .where('role', '==', 'pir')               // equality
    .where('active', '!=', false)             // INEQUALITY - causes failure
    .get();
```

**Why it failed:**
- Firestore cannot combine multiple equality filters with an inequality filter without a specific composite index
- The `!=` operator is particularly problematic
- Query would fail silently, returning 0 results
- No error visible to user

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed `.where('active', '!=', false)` from Firestore query
- Filter active status in JavaScript after receiving results
- Added comprehensive logging

```javascript
// FIXED QUERY (line 11334-11337)
const pirsSnap = await db.collection('users')
    .where('tenantId', '==', CURRENT_TENANT)
    .where('role', '==', 'pir')
    .get();

// Filter in JavaScript (line 11347-11350)
if (pirData.active === false) {
    console.log('  ‚äò Skipping inactive PIR:', pirData.displayName);
    continue;
}
```

### 3. **My PIRs View - Potential Assignment Mismatch**
**Location:** `MyPIRsView.loadMyPIRs()` (line 5070-5180)

**Problem:**
Query filters by `assignedCoach === user.uid`, but if PIRs don't have Tyler's UID in the assignedCoach field, they won't appear.

**Query:**
```javascript
db.collection('users')
    .where('tenantId', '==', CURRENT_TENANT)
    .where('assignedCoach', '==', user.uid)
    .where('role', '==', 'pir')
```

**Likely Issue:**
- PIRs may not have `assignedCoach` field set
- Or `assignedCoach` field contains wrong UID
- User should verify in Firestore Console

**Verification Required:**
Check if PIR documents have:
```javascript
{
  assignedCoach: "[Tyler's UID]",  // Must match exactly
  role: "pir",
  tenantId: "glrs"
}
```

---

### 4. **Community View - Potentially Working**
**Location:** `CommunityView.calculateStats()` (line 6861-6946)

**Status:** Likely working, but may hit similar issues as Dashboard

**Queries Verified:**
- Line 6864-6868: Messages query has tenantId filter ‚úì
- Line 6951-6958: Analytics query has tenantId filter ‚úì
- All sub-queries have tenantId filters ‚úì

**Potential Issue:**
- May fail silently if chart rendering errors occur
- Stats calculation happens after data loading (same pattern as Dashboard)

**Monitoring:**
- Console logs will show if queries succeed
- If showing 0, check browser console for errors

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Verify Dashboard Fix
1. Refresh admin portal
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Look for logs:
   ```
   üîÑ Loading dashboard data for tenant: glrs
   ‚úì Loaded users: [number]
   ‚úì Found X PIRs and Y coaches
   ‚úì Processed PIRs for Active PIRs widget: X
   üìä Loading alerts...
   ‚úì Loaded alerts: X
   ‚úÖ Stats set: {totalPirs: X, totalCoaches: Y, ...}
   ```
4. **Expected Result:** Dashboard shows correct counts (3 PIRs, N coaches, etc.)

### 2. Verify Goals View Fix
1. Navigate to Goals tab
2. Open browser console
3. Look for logs:
   ```
   üéØ GoalsView: Loading PIRs for tenant: glrs
   ‚úì GoalsView: Found X total PIRs
   ‚úÖ GoalsView: Loaded X active PIRs with stats
   ```
4. **Expected Result:** Goals view shows 3 PIRs (Heinz, Michael, Tyler)

### 3. Fix My PIRs View (Manual Data Fix Required)
1. Open Firestore Console
2. Navigate to `users` collection
3. For each PIR (Heinz, Michael, Tyler):
   - Check if `assignedCoach` field exists
   - Verify it contains Tyler's correct UID
   - If missing or wrong, update to Tyler's UID
4. Refresh My PIRs view
5. **Expected Result:** Shows all assigned PIRs

## Firestore Data Verification

### Required Checks in Firebase Console

#### 1. Verify PIR Documents
Navigate to: `users` collection

Check each PIR document has:
```javascript
{
  tenantId: "glrs",           // REQUIRED
  role: "pir",                // REQUIRED
  active: true,               // or undefined (false hides PIR)
  assignedCoach: "[UID]",     // Tyler's UID for My PIRs view
  displayName: "...",
  email: "...",
  // ... other fields
}
```

#### 2. Verify Tyler's User Document
Navigate to: `users/[Tyler's UID]`

Verify:
```javascript
{
  tenantId: "glrs",
  role: "superadmin",  // Allows access to all features
  email: "tyler@glrecoveryservices.com",
  // ... other fields
}
```

#### 3. Verify Indexes Exist
Navigate to: Firestore ‚Üí Indexes

**Required Composite Indexes:**
```
Collection: checkIns
Fields: tenantId (ASC), createdAt (DESC)

Collection: alerts
Fields: tenantId (ASC), createdAt (DESC)

Collection: messages
Fields: tenantId (ASC), createdAt (DESC)
Fields: tenantId (ASC), roomId (ASC), createdAt (DESC)

Collection: users
Fields: tenantId (ASC), role (ASC)
Fields: tenantId (ASC), assignedCoach (ASC), role (ASC)
```

If indexes are missing, Firestore will prompt to create them when queries fail.

## Debugging Tools

### Console Logging Added
All critical queries now log:
- ‚úÖ Success (green checkmark)
- ‚ùå Error (red X)
- üîÑ Loading state (blue circular arrow)
- üéØ Starting operation (target emoji)
- ‚äò Skipped item (prohibition sign)

### Example Console Output (Success):
```
üîÑ Loading dashboard data for tenant: glrs
‚úì Loaded users: 5
‚úì Found 3 PIRs and 1 coaches
‚úì Processed PIRs for Active PIRs widget: 3
üìä Loading alerts...
‚úì Loaded alerts: 2
‚úÖ Stats set: {totalPirs: 3, totalCoaches: 1, alertsToday: 2, avgCompliance: 85}
üéØ GoalsView: Loading PIRs for tenant: glrs
‚úì GoalsView: Found 3 total PIRs
‚úÖ GoalsView: Loaded 3 active PIRs with stats
```

### Example Console Output (Error):
```
üîÑ Loading dashboard data for tenant: glrs
‚úì Loaded users: 5
‚úì Found 3 PIRs and 1 coaches
‚ùå GoalsView: Error loading PIRs: [error details]
```

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (Required)
1. ‚úÖ **Refresh browser** to load fixed code
2. ‚úÖ **Check browser console** for logs
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Verify Firestore data** (PIRs have tenantId, role, assignedCoach)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Create missing indexes** if Firestore prompts

### Short-term (Recommended)
1. Add automated tests for dashboard queries
2. Add error boundary to catch query failures
3. Add user-friendly error messages (currently silent failures)
4. Add data validation on user creation

### Long-term (Optional)
1. Migrate to Firestore Security Rules v2 with better error handling
2. Add health check dashboard showing query status
3. Add automated data validation scripts
4. Consider pagination for large datasets

---

## Known Limitations

### Current Implementation
1. **No error UI:** If queries fail, user sees 0 with no explanation
2. **Silent failures:** Missing indexes cause silent 0 results
3. **No retry logic:** Failed queries don't retry
4. **Console-only debugging:** Must open developer tools to see issues

### Future Improvements
1. Add toast notifications for query failures
2. Add "Refresh" button with visual feedback
3. Add fallback data or cached values
4. Add health indicators (üü¢üü°üî¥) for each metric
